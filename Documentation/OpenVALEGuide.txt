User Guide

	Contents of the OpenVALE folder:
i. OpenVALE.exe
- OpenVALE executable
ii. OpenVALE_Data
- Folder containing the runtime files for OpenVALE, must be in the same folder as OpenVALE.exe
iii. UnityPlayer.dll
- Runtime library for the Unity Player, must be in the same folder as OpenVALE.exe
iv. OpenVALEConfig.xml
- Contains configuration settings for OpenVALE
v. DemoServer
- Contains AudioServer3 with settings for running with OpenVALE.

	When you first open OpenVALE.exe you should see : 

	
	To test whether OpenVALE is working, run the demo script included (Matlab and Python 			formats).
	
	All coordinate values for position should be passed and returned as Front,Left,Top (FLT).  			Positive forward,left,up.

	The connection port for commands is 43201.
	
	If the user presses the escape button, a “quit” string will be sent out to all connections on 43202.
		The escapes buttons are:
			Rift – B
			Vive – Application Menu
			None - q

Configuration Settings

	Filename:
		OpenVALEConfig.xml

	Format example:
		<setting name="SpatialAudioServerRootDir" serializeAs="string">
			<value>./DemoServer</value>
		</setting>
		
	List of values:
		SpatialAudioServerRootDir  
			- Only supports absolute path or relative subfolders

		SpatialAudioEngineType
			- Possible values "AudioServer3" or "SlabServer"

		HRTFDirectory
			- Absolute path to folder containing HRTFs
	
		WavPath
			- Absolute path to folder containing .wav files

		ASIOInputChannels
			- Comma seperated list of integers.
			- Zero based
			- Example : 0,1,2,3

		LevelName
			- Name of a level built in the OpenVALE 
			- If blank will use Virtual ALF

		HMDType 
			- Possible values "Rift", “Vive”, or "None"
If blank will default to Rift
Use “None” for keyboard controls.  WASD to rotate and Spacebar to respond.

Command List

	All commands that the return format of commandname,status code,return values. (ie 				AddAudioSource will return AddAudioSource,0,1)
	
Pre-render

	hrtfID = loadHRTF(filename)
		- Loads an HRTF file
		- if successful will return the OpenVALE ID for the HRTF which can be used for future 				calls
		- Example 1: loadHRTF(KEMAR.slh)
	
	srcID = addAudioSource(Type, initialPosition, HRTFid, extraParams)
		- Initializes source in the sound engine and returns the OpenVALE reference for the 				source
		- Current supported values for Type are: wav, noiseGen, ASIO
		- InitialPosition is of format [f,l,t]
		- extraParams for wav source filename=wavname.wav
		- extraParams for asio source number of channels integer
		- Example 1: addAudioSource(wav,[2,0,1],0,filename=wavname.wav)
		- Example 2: addAudioSource(noiseGen,[3,1,3],0)
		- Example 3: addAudioSource(asio,[3,1,3],0,6)

	err = startRendering
		- Sets the sound engine to render mode
		- All unmuted and enabled source begin play
		- Example startRendering()

	err = defineFront 
		- define the origin of position and azimuth based on the HMDs current orientation and 				position
	
	err = getSubjectNumber
		- displays a number panel for entering subject numbers.
- Subject number entered must be 1-4 digits
- Client expected to choose input method (ie Crosshair)
- Example: getSubjectNumber()

During Render Commands

	err = enableSrc(srcID,T/F)
		- Enable or disable a source based on the boolean passed
		- Example enableSrc(1,T)

	err = setHRTF(sourceNumber,HRTFid)
		- Assign an HRTF to the source
		- Example setHRTF(0,0)

	err = adjustSourceLevel(srcID,relativeLevel)
		- Adjust the relative level of an audio source
		- srcID is the OpenVALE audio source ID
		- relative level is in dB
		- Example adjustSourceLevel(1,5)
	
	err =adjustOverallLevel(relativeLevel)
		- Adjust the relative level of all sources
		- relative level is in dB
		- Example adjustOverallLevel(5)
	
	err =adjustSourcePosition(srcID, Position = [x,y,z] or SpkID)
		- Moves a source to a new position
		- srcID is the OpenVALE audio source ID
		- Position of the format [f,l,t]
		- spkID is the ID of the speaker in ALF
		- Example 1: adjustSourcePosition(1,[1,2,3])
		- Example 2: adjustSourcePosition(1,274)
	
	err =muteAudioSource(srcID,T/F)
		- Mutes an audio source 
		- Example muteAudioSource(1,T)
	
	err = setLEDs(Position = [x,y,z] or SpkID, LEDMask = [1,0,0,1])
		- Set LEDs on/off based on nearest speaker to position or speaker ID
		- For LEDMask 1 = turn LED on, 0 = turn LED off
		- Example setLEDs([f,l,t],[1,0,1,0])
		- Example setLEDs(1,[1,0,1,0])
	
	err = showFreeCursor(whichCursor = {‘head’,’hand’}, T/F)
		- Shows the cursor attached to chosen object
		- Example showFreeCursor(head,T)
	
	err = showSnappedCursor(whichCursor = {‘head’,’hand’}, T/F)
		- Turns on the LEDs of the speaker the user is pointing toward
- Example showSnappedCursor(head,T)

	err = reset()
		- Stops rendering
		- Removes all sources and HRTFs
- Example reset()

	err = displayMessage(String)
- Displays a message to the user
- Example displayMesage(“Hello”)
Runtime Queries
	
	spkID, respTime = waitForResponse()	
		- Waits for the user to press the trigger on the right hand controller 
		- Returns nearest speaker ID to the currently active cursor
		- if no cursor is active, returns the nearest speaker to free cursor attached to the head
	
	err =waitForReCenter(spkID or position,tolerance)
		- Waits for the user to face a specified position or speaker
		- Tolerance is in radians
		- Example 1 : waitForReCenter(1,.1)
		- Example 2 : waitForReCenter([1,2,3], .1)
	
	[orientation] = getHeadOrientation()
		- returns the heads current orientation in Yaw Pitch Roll Radians
	
	[position],[orientation] = getHead6DOF()
		- returns the position in FLT meters
		- returns orientation in YPR Radians
	
	spkID,errorDistance = getNearestSpeaker(position) 
		- Returns the nearest speaker to the given position
		- error distance in is meters
		- Example : getNearestSpeaker([1,2,3])

	[position] = getSpeakerPosition(spkID) 
		- Returns the FLT position of the speaker ID
		- Example : getSpeakerPosition(1)

	err = highlightlocation(spkID or position,color)
		- Shows a highlighted location with a specified color
		- Color format [r,g,b] where r g b are between 0,1
		- Calling highlightLocation() will hide the highlight
		- Example : highlightlocation(274,[1,.5,1])
		- Example : highlightlocation([2,1.7,4],[1,.5,1])

Known Issues

	- Using “None” for HMDType with HMD connected will prevent use of controller.
